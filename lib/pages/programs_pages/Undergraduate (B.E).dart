These eligible candidates can get admitted to any of the constituent and affiliated colleges according to the admission process followed by corresponding college. The admission process practiced by the constituent colleges is the same, but process followed by the affiliated colleges may differ from one another.\n\nEach year IOE publishes a help book along with the announcement of entrance examination of that year. This book contains all the required information for an interested candidate to appear in the exam an finally get admitted to any of the constituent or affiliated colleges. This book also contains the current intake capacity of each of the colleges. Fee structure and scholarship schemes of constituent colleges are also provided in that book (BE Booklet 2072).\n\nIOE bachelor programs are available on all of its constituent campuses and the affiliated colleges while the masters programs are available only at its constituent campuses: Pulchowk Campus, Thapathali Campus, and Pashchimanchal Campus.\n\nThe following are the graduate course available in IOE :",

Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual microcontrollers, microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers, to circuit design. This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture.\n\nUsual tasks involving computer engineers include writing software and firmware for embedded microcontrollers, designing VLSI chips, designing analog sensors, designing mixed signal circuit boards, and designing operating systems. Computer engineers are also suited for robotics research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like motors, communications, and sensors.'),
